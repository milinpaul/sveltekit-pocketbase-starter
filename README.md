## How to Deploy PocketBase on [fly.io](https://fly.io/).

I used to deploy the pocketbase on fly.io for free. You could follow [this link](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions/537) to host pocketbase on fly.io.

Since [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) uses docker for app deployment, we created a [**Dockerfile**](https://github.com/milinpaul/sveltekit-pocketbase-starter/blob/main/Dockerfile) for easy deployment.

Checkout the [**offical doc**](https://pocketbase.io/docs/going-to-production/#using-docker) for more info and also checkout the official [**Going to production**](https://pocketbase.io/docs/going-to-production/) doc.
